'''
    from __experimental__ import approx

defines some syntax for approximate comparisons within a certain tolerance that
must have been previously defined by two variables visible in the current scope:

    rel_tol  # relative tolerance
    abs_tol  # absolute tolerance

These comparisons are done using `math.isclose()`; see this function's
docstring to learn more about the value of the two parameters.

The comparison operators are:

    ~=    # approximately equal
    <~=   # less than or approximately equal
    >~=   # greater than or approximately equal

Given two mathematical terms or expressions a and b, they can occur:

    - on a single line
    - immediately following an assert keyword
    - immediately following an if keyword

However, in the current implementation, anything else will fail.  

    abs_tol = rel_tol = 1e-8
    assert 0.1 + 0.2 ~= 0.3

will work; however

    abs_tol = rel_tol = 1e-8
    assert not 1 + 2 ~= 3

will raise an AssertionError, because the `not` will not be parsed correctly.


Here's the result of a quick demo
